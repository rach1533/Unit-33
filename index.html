<span id="intro"> Why coffee prices are going up </span></div>
    <br>
<p>
  Coffee prices are the highest they have been in a decade, sorry news for coffee lovers and addicts. A recent drought in Brazil and ongoing supply chain issues have caused a sharp rise in coffee bean prices. In addition the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit has caused coffee shops to add further price increases to cover their overheads. Elizabeth Windsor from Peckham stated 'these prices are ridiculous I shouldnt have to sell me crown jewels to buy a mocha'. As the cost of food and the price of raw materials continue to rise globally we are unlikely to see prices decrease any time soon. Coffee Daily! will be sure to keep you updated!
